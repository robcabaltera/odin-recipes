    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>If all the sweetness in this home were a dish, it would be a tall stack of pancakes with golden syrup and nature's berries cascading from the top.</p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, egg and oil. Mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
